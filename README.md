## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
Traditional farming practices and urban plant care face significant hurdles that hinder productivity and sustainability. Farmers grapple with inefficient disease detection methods, leading to yield losses and increased costs. Unpredictable crop outcomes and suboptimal fertilizer use further contribute to resource wastage and environmental concerns. Industries struggle to meet the demands of a growing population while minimizing ecological impact. Urban plant parents lack access to reliable tools for nurturing healthy plants.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
Introducing our web-based app revolutionizing agriculture and urban plant care. Harnessing the power of ML and IoT, we offer disease detection, crop prediction, and optimal fertilizer utilization. Empowering farmers, industries, and urban plant parents, our app streamlines operations, boosts yields, and ensures healthier plants. Experience data-driven solutions for smarter agriculture and greener urban environments.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
As a future scope to this project, there is a lot that can be integrated in order to make it a more smoother and scalable product. We would be introducing a ml model which will take the name of crop and tell where in india the crop is best grown this will be an advantage for industry players to buy the land efficently .
We will create twio seprate communities one where farmers can share new advancements and other for plant hobbists\enthusiasts where they can intreact and share common love for gardening. \
